This new era of lunar exploration is called Artemis. Named after the twin sister of Apollo, she is the Goddess of the Moon, and we are the Artemis Generation. NASA is building a coalition of partnerships with industry, nations and academia that will help us get to the Moon quickly and sustainably, together. Our work to catalyze the U.S. space economy with public-private partnerships has made it possible to accomplish more than ever before. The budget we need to achieve everything laid out in this plan represents bipartisan support from the Congress. Today, NASA is delivering more missions, more science, and more innovation at a better value for the American taxpayer than at any point in the agency\u2019s history and with half the buying power than 1964, when Apollo development was at its peak.

We thank the President, the Congress, the American taxpayers, and the emerging space industry for the combined efforts to strengthen our nation\u2019s space program. Under the Artemis program, humanity will explore regions of the Moon never visited before, uniting people around the unknown, the never seen, and the once impossible. We will return to the Moon robotically beginning next year, send astronauts to the surface within four years, and build a long- term presence on the Moon by the end of the decade. I am proud to share NASA\u2019s Artemis Plan\u2014this is how we will go to the Moon once again. And how we will use the Moon as the stepping stone for our next greatest leap\u2014human exploration of Mars. We are going, and we go together. Ad lunam! NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine 9 Introduction America has entered a new era of exploration. NASA\u2019s Artemis program will lead humanity forward to the Moon and prepare us for the next giant leap, the exploration of Mars. It has been almost 50 years since astronauts last walked on the lunar surface during the Apollo program, and since then the robotic exploration of deep space has seen decades of technological advancement and scientific discoveries. For the last 20 years, humans have continuously lived and worked aboard the International Space Station 250 miles above Earth, preparing for the day we move farther into the solar system. Sending human explorers 250,000 miles to the Moon, then 140 million miles to Mars, requires a bold vision, effective program management, funding for modern systems development and mission operations, and support from all corners",

Sending human explorers 250,000 miles to the Moon, then 140 million miles to Mars, requires a bold vision, effective program management, funding for modern systems development and mission operations, and support from all corners of our great nation as well as our partners across the globe. NASA has been fine-tuning the plan to achieve that bold vision since the president called on the agency in December 2017 to lead a human return to the Moon and beyond with commercial and international partners. Two years later, he challenged us yet again, this time to send the first woman and next man to the Moon within five years. NASA is implementing the Artemis program to achieve those goals, and this document lays out the agency\u2019s Moon to Mars exploration approach explaining how we will do it. The Moon plan is twofold: it\u2019s focused on achieving the goal of an initial human landing by 2024 with acceptable technical risks, while simultaneously working toward sustainable lunar exploration in the mid- to late 2020s. 2024 is not an arbitrary date. It is the most ambitious date possible, and our success at the Moon, and later, at Mars, will be grounded in our national goals and robust capabilities. The United States leads in space exploration now; however, as more countries and companies take aim at the Moon, America needs the earliest possible landing to maintain and build on that leadership, as well as to prepare for a historic first human mission to Mars. Landing astronauts on the Moon within four years will better focus this global initiative on the engineering, technology development, and process improvements necessary to safely and successfully carry out sustained human exploration of the Moon.

It also paves the way for U.S. commercial companies and international partners to further contribute to the exploration and development of the Moon. We need several years in orbit and on the surface of the Moon to build operational confidence for conducting long-term work and supporting life away from Earth before we can embark on the first multi-year human mission to Mars. The sooner we get to the Moon, the sooner we get American astronauts to Mars. We need to act fast to make this vision a reality, and a crewed lunar landing by 2024 is the key to a successful Moon to Mars exploration approach. Our next lunar landing paves the way for a new and sustainable lunar economy\u2014one where U.S. companies and international partners will benefit from and build on what we learn. 10 Early Artemis Missions With the powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft nearing the end of testing and development, the agency has the foundation needed to send humans back to lunar orbit. In preparation for the safest earliest possible lunar landing, NASA seeks to make full use of early Artemis missions through additional testing for Orion and the Human Landing System (HLS) when possible. The Gateway is a critical component of the agency\u2019s sustainable lunar operations. NASA will integrate the first two pieces on Earth, launching the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) together in 2023 on a single rocket, followed by a commercial logistics supply launch.

In 2024, Orion will deliver its crew to lunar orbit. The commercially developed lander that will take the crew to the lunar surface will be capable of docking directly to Orion for crew transfer for early Artemis missions, but NASA is maintaining flexibility for optional docking to the Gateway. On the surface, the crew will wear the new exploration extravehicular mobility unit or xEMU spacesuit as they explore the surface for about a week before returning to Orion for the trip home to Earth. Sustainable Artemis Missions On later Artemis missions crew will arrive at the Gateway aboard Orion. On the Gateway, they will be able to conduct research and take trips down to the surface. NASA will work with Artemis providers to ensure spacecraft are built to international interoperability standards with as many reusable components as possible for long-term sustainability at the Moon. Long-standing International Space Station partners are eager to join NASA in lunar orbit. The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has committed to providing advanced robotics for the Gateway, and ESA (European Space Agency) plans to provide the International Habitat (IHab) and the ESPRIT module, which will deliver additional communications capabilities, a science airlock for deploying science payloads and CubeSats, and refueling of the Gateway.

The Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) has expressed interest in cooperation on Gateway as well. At the lunar South Pole, NASA and its partners will develop an Artemis Base Camp to support longer expeditions on the lunar surface. Planned Base Camp elements include a lunar terrain vehicle (LTV, or unpressurized rover), a habitable mobility platform (pressurized rover), a lunar foundation habitation module, power systems, ad in-situ resource utilization systems. This incremental build-up of capabilities on and around the Moon is essential to establishing long- term exploration of Earth\u2019s nearest neighbor and preparing for human exploration of Mars. 11 Chapter 1: Setting Humanity on a Sustainable Course to the Moon The Artemis program builds on a half-century of experience and preparation to establish a robust human-robotic presence on and around the Moon. With clear direction from the White House, coordination among the reestablished National Space Council, strong bipartisan support in Congress, and robust participation from industry and international partnerships, Artemis is a globally unifying endeavor. America will lead the monumental shift that frees humanity from our innate bonds to Earth. This is the decade in which the Artemis Generation will teach us how to live on other worlds. The Basis for a Lunar Architecture NASA was ready for Space Policy Directive-1, the call from the President to return to the Moon and get ready for Mars, and was already prepared to offer architectural and hardware solutions to leverage the core deep space transportation systems\u2014the SLS rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the supporting Exploration Ground Systems (EGS)\u2014to return humans to the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years.

Through partnerships with U.S. industry, NASA was already developing 21st century deep space habitation capabilities and investing in lunar lander technologies. Ongoing spacesuit upgrades have resulted in a lunar surface suit that affords more frequent spacewalks through improved safety features, custom fitting, simplified maintenance, and better communications. A cross-agency 12 architecture team also had been formulating plans for a Gateway orbiting the Moon. This plan garnered significant support from international partners and was reflected in the Global Exploration Roadmap as a collaborative effort that would \u201copen the space frontier for human exploration of the Moon, Mars and asteroids as we expand human exploration and commerce into deep space.\u201d In 2018, with support from the highest-level national decision makers, NASA proposed a plan to return humans to the lunar surface by 2028. This plan included the Gateway from which human landers could be deployed. There was strong international support for the orbiting lunar outpost, and International Space Station partners proposed additional capabilities they could contribute. The Gateway program advanced from formulation to program status in late 2018. NASA also established the Commercial Lunar Payload Services or CLPS initiative in 2018, encouraging the U.S. commercial space industry to introduce new lander technologies to deliver NASA and commercial payloads to the surface of the Moon. With 14 CLPS providers currently on contract and eligible to bid on payload deliveries to the Moon, NASA solicits bids from the companies as needed and awards surface task orders for lunar surface deliveries.

A task order was awarded in June 2020 to Astrobotic of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to deliver NASA\u2019s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover or VIPER in 2023. The agency plans to send science instruments and technology experiments to the surface at least twice per year on CLPS flights. NASA has already selected more than two dozen instruments to study the Moon and test new technologies for these early CLPS flights, including VIPER. The agency also has announced a new process to build an internal database of future lunar surface investigations. Through the Payloads and Research Investigations on the Surface of the Moon or PRISM, NASA is interested in investigations that maximize basic and applied science and technology demonstrations at different lunar locations, as well as individual investigation components that would be valuable at multiple locations. The agency will use the PRISM information to inform the manifests of future CLPS deliveries beginning in 2023. The agency will periodically open up PRISM requests for information to collect new ideas and investigations eligible for future CLPS flight opportunities. Meanwhile in 2018, NASA began the acquisition process for commercially provided Human Landing Systems (HLS) to meet the goal of sending humans back to the Moon.

NASA originally selected nine CLPS providers, but as the need to deliver heavier payloads became apparent, the agency later added five more companies. In May 2019, NASA awarded the first two task awards for 12 instrument deliveries to Astrobotic (Pittsburgh, PA) and Intuitive Machines (Houston, TX). Those initial flights are launching in 2021, and NASA is planning for two deliveries per year thereafter. SCIENCE 13 design and develop an HLS capable of accessing any part of the Moon and reusing sections of the system to increase affordability. The team issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (NextSTEP Appendix E) to U.S. industry, seeking HLS studies, risk reduction, development, and demonstration. Proposals were due March 25, 2019, one day before Vice President Pence issued a new challenge to NASA: land the first woman and next man on the Moon by 2024\u2014four years earlier than originally planned. NASA moved quickly to respond to the Vice President\u2019s challenge. By May 2019, NASA had selected 11 companies across eight states under NextSTEP Appendix E to conduct studies and produce system-level prototypes to reduce risk and advance human lander technologies. Appendix E immediately allowed NASA to engage with commercial industry on early designs and how to best set up a rapid development approach to meet the 2024 objectives.

Following a second draft in August and after addressing more than 1,150 comments, the final Appendix H solicitation was issued in October 2019. Awards were made to three companies in spring 2020. Program Status Assessment In January 2020, NASA\u2019s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) chartered a program status assessment (PSA) of activities planned to achieve a human landing on the Moon by 2024. The assessment comprised teams of NASA personnel and outside aerospace experts who examined the overall early Artemis architecture, including Orion, SLS, Exploration Ground Systems (EGS), Gateway, HLS, and system engineering and cross-program integration. Members of the PSA teams examined management and integration across programs, schedule risks, technical risks, technical systems engineering integration, and test program thoroughness. Following the six-week assessment, PSA findings indicated that the Artemis III approach that was baselined for the original 2028 landing timeline\u2014and therefore the schedule to meet the goal of landing the first woman and next man on the Moon by 2024\u2014was significantly dependent on new technology maturation. Based on the findings, NASA is conducting studies with the HLS vendors to investigate where high TRL systems may improve schedule for Artemis III. 14 Another change resulting from the PSA findings included launching the Gateway\u2019s PPE and HALO together on a single rocket.

While in lunar orbit, this early Gateway will demonstrate its unique orbit and operate science payloads in deep space. A snapshot of \u201cfirsts\u201d to be achieved through the Artemis program. 15 Chapter 2: Landing Humans on the Moon in 2024 The foundation for our return to the Moon is NASA\u2019s deep space transportation system: the Orion spacecraft, SLS rocket, the HLS, and the EGS facilities that include a modernized spaceport. The Orion spacecraft, powered by a service module provided by ESA (the European Space Agency), has been specifically designed for deep space human operations for up to four crew. The SLS rocket is the human rated heavy-lift rocket designed to launch Orion and send it on missions to the Moon. Next year, science and technology will lead our return to the Moon as we see the first payloads delivered to the lunar surface aboard CLPS provider landers and 13 CubeSats deployed from the SLS during Artemis I\u2014five of which will return lunar data. Human exploration under the Artemis program will begin with the crewed flight test of SLS and Orion on Artemis II in 2023.

NASA\u2019s goal is to conduct in-space testing of every possible hardware, software, and operational system required for Artemis III prior to the mission in 2024. Artemis I and Mission Readiness The Artemis I SLS rocket will launch an uncrewed Orion into Earth orbit, placing it on a path toward a lunar distant retrograde orbit, where it will travel 40,000 miles beyond the Moon, or a total of about 280,000 miles from Earth before returning home. This crucial flight test will demonstrate the performance of the SLS rocket on its maiden flight and gather engineering data throughout before Orion returns on a high-speed Earth reentry at Mach 32, or 24,500 miles per hour. The high speed lunar velocity reentry is the top mission priority and a necessary test of the heat shield\u2019s performance as it enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere, heating to nearly 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014about half as hot as the surface of the sun\u2014before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean for retrieval and post-flight engineering assessment. For this uncrewed configuration, engineering equipment will fly in place of astronaut-essential elements. Instead of the cockpit displays and controls and life support systems that will fly on the first crewed flight, this first flight will carry the data-gathering tools needed to validate performance and compare predictive models with actual flight data. Over the course of the four-to-six-week mission, Orion will travel more than 1.4 million miles prior to returning to Earth, surpassing Apollo 13\u2019s record for distance traveled from Earth in a spacecraft designed for humans.

This mission will also deploy 13 CubeSats to conduct new scientific investigations and new technology demonstrations that will improve our knowledge of the deep space environment, while engaging a broader set of universities, international partners, and private companies in lunar exploration than ever before on a single mission. Artemis I will leverage excess volume on the massive SLS rocket to carry 13 CubeSats to deep space and deploy them to conduct science and technology research. These \u201chitchhiker\u201d payloads are provided by NASA, U.S. companies, academic institutions and international partners. Five of them will return important data about the lunar environment to inform future Artemis missions. SCIENCE 16 Preparations for Artemis I are well underway. Production is complete for the SLS engines\u2014comprising four RS-25 liquid rocket engines, two solid rocket boosters, the massive core stage, and the interim cryogenic propulsion stage that provides Orion\u2019s final push toward the Moon\u2014and all are completing preflight tests. Beyond significant ground tests when NASA has fired elements of the rocket from test stands in Mississippi, Utah, and Alabama, a fully integrated series of ground tests will take place at Kennedy Space Center before a final Flight Readiness Review prior to the Artemis I launch. Orion\u2019s maiden flight test, Exploration Flight Test-1, flew on December 5, 2014.

NASA completed the final series of Orion parachute tests in September 2018. The system includes 11 parachutes that begin deploying at almost five miles in altitude. Over the course of eight qualification tests at the U.S. Army\u2019s Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, engineers have evaluated the performance of Orion\u2019s parachute system during normal landing sequences as well as numerous failure scenarios and a variety of potential aerodynamic conditions to ensure astronauts can return safely from deep space missions. Space Launch System Mock Up arrives at Kennedy for Testing. NASA\u2019s Pegasus Barge arrived at the Launch Complex 39 turn basin wharf at Kennedy Space Center in Florida to make its first delivery to Kennedy in support of the agency\u2019s Artemis missions. The upgraded 310-foot-long barge arrived September 27, 2019, ferrying the 212-foot-long Space Launch System rocket core stage pathfinder. Weighing in at 228,000 pounds, the Pathfinder is a full-scale mock-up of the rocket\u2019s core stage and will be used to validate ground support equipment and demonstrate it can be integrated with Kennedy facilities. 17 In 2019, NASA conducted a successful test known as Ascent Abort-2, which tested the Orion launch abort system that sits atop Orion at launch and during ascent. If an emergency occurs during launch, the launch abort system pulls Orion and its crew away from the rocket to land in the Atlantic Ocean. The three-minute test proved that Orion\u2019s launch abort system can outrun a speeding rocket during high- stress aerodynamic conditions",

The Orion crew module for the Artemis I mission has been fully assembled, tested, and integrated with the European service module. The service module, built by ESA, provides most of the propulsion, power, and cooling systems for the crew module where astronauts will live and work during Artemis missions. The integrated spacecraft successfully completed simulated in-space environments testing, verifying that Orion\u2019s systems will perform as expected during Artemis missions. Inside the world\u2019s largest vacuum chamber, the spacecraft was subjected to the extreme electromagnetic conditions and temperatures (-250 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit) of space. The campaign was completed ahead of schedule, and the spacecraft has since returned to the space coast for final preparations ahead of integration with the SLS rocket. A launch abort system with a test version of Orion attached soars upward on NASA\u2019s Ascent Abort-2 (AA-2) flight test atop a Northrop Grumman provided booster on July 2, 2019. 18 NASA\u2019s ground systems team has modified the infrastructure and ground support equipment necessary to launch Artemis missions and recover Orion.

One such example is an extensible and scalable lunar communications and navigation architecture, known as LunaNet. With a LunaNet architecture in place, robotic landers, rovers, and astronauts on the Moon will have network access similar to networks on Earth. Rovers analyzing samples can send their data to relays orbiting the Moon, which can then transmit that data back to Earth. Astronauts on the lunar surface will be able to receive real-time alerts generated from space weather instruments of incoming solar flares, giving them ample time to seek cover.

Lunar Resources As our sustained presence grows at the Moon, opportunities to harvest lunar resources could lead to safer, more efficient operations with less dependence on supplies delivered from Earth. NASA has several current ISRU investments through partnerships with industry and academia. Prospecting, extraction and mining initiatives are advancing our capabilities to find and harness resources from the lunar regolith. Chemical and thermal process developments may provide options to break down naturally occurring minerals and compounds found on the Moon and convert them to human consumables or even propellant.

And while the Moon has no atmosphere, we know that the Mars atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide, so NASA is also investing in initiatives to focus on atmospheric extraction and conversion of CO2 to other useful elements or compounds. In April 2020, the White House issued an Executive Order, \u201cEncouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources,\u201d addressing U.S. policy regarding the recovery and use of resources from the Moon and other celestial bodies. This Executive Order directs the Secretary of State to lead a U.S. Government effort to develop joint statements, bilateral agreements, and multilateral instruments with like-minded foreign states to enable safe and sustainable operations for the commercial recovery and use of space resources. NASA is supporting State Department efforts to advance the Executive Order by conducting a trailblazing purchase of an extraterrestrial resource. Specifically, NASA plans to purchase from one or more Astronauts at Artemis Base Camp will test a wide set of new technologies in six priority areas encompassed by NASA\u2019s Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative. For example, advancing ISRU technologies could lead to future production of fuel, water, and/or oxygen from local materials, decreasing supply needs from Earth. Advanced solar and fission power systems and autonomous manufacturing technologies could also be demonstrated at the Artemis Base Camp for long-duration operations on the Moon and Mars.

The four crew are then reunited at the Gateway for another multi-month stay, simulating the return trip to Earth, before landing back home. These missions will be by far the longest human deep space missions in history. They will be the operational tests of our technical and operational readiness for the first human Mars mission. Summary All major components required to lead a robust human return to the Moon are underway, with U.S. commercial lunar robotic deliveries leading the way in 2021. NASA\u2019s deep space transportation systems are in the final stages of testing before integration. The Artemis I and Artemis II flight tests will validate rocket and spacecraft performance and set America on a course to once again return astronauts to the Moon. NASA will also work with commercial partners to build landers and conduct risk-reducing tests in the lead-up to the landings on the Artemis III mission and beyond. Our charge is bold and to meet it, we must employ innovative development approaches. At every milestone we will learn and improve our technical methods.

Technology investments for Artemis are being targeted at technologies that would vastly reduce the cost of deep space exploration, making possible even more ambitious missions to Mars. By working side by side with commercial enterprises and international partners, combining knowledge and expertise to fully explore the lunar surface, many technical advances and breakthroughs will be made that will feed technological and economic growth on Earth. Technology Goals The Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative (LSII) activities are implemented through a combination of in-house activities, competitive programs, and public-private partnerships aimed to spur the creation of novel technologies needed for lunar surface exploration and accelerate the technology readiness of crucial systems and components. Priorities Through LSII, NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) is developing and demonstrating capabilities to retire technology hurdles in the following areas: \u2022 In-situ resource utilization technologies for collecting, processing, storing, and using material found or manufactured on the Moon or other planetary bodies. \u2022 Surface power technologies that provide the capability for sustainable, continuous power throughout the lunar day and night. \u2022 Dust mitigation technologies that diminish dust hazards on lunar surface systems such as cameras, solar panels, spacesuits, and instrumentation. \u2022 Extreme environment technologies that enable systems to operate throughout the range of lunar",

Engineers have conducted 16 drop tests of an Orion test article in the hydro impact basin at the Landing and Impact Research Facility at NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. They investigated landing technologies, including air bags, retro rockets, shock absorbing struts and crushable structures.

The campaign of swing and vertical drops simulated water landing scenarios to account for different velocities, parachute deployments, entry angles, wave heights and wind conditions the spacecraft may encounter when landing in the ocean. Orion Heat Shield Testing The Orion heat shield was redesigned from one piece to individual blocks of material following the Exploration Flight Test-1 in 2014. This new design introduced several unknowns that prompted further testing and risk reduction. Engineers performed more than 30 tests across the United States on the new design to investigate the effects of the block structure that could disrupt the smooth airflow and cause localized heating spots.

Understanding both effects is critical to confirm the heat shield will thermally protect the astronauts during reentry. Testing concluded in March 2019 at Langley with a 6-inch Orion heat shield model in the 20-inch Mach 6 wind tunnel. The 6-inch Orion heat shield model was machined to represent small-scale features, including the patterns expected as the heat shield ablates, or slowly burns away as planned, during reentry flight. Orion\u2019s heat shield will help it endure the approximately 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit it will experience upon reentry. The heat shield that will protect Orion on Artemis I was installed on the crew module in Aug. 2018. Orion Parachute Testing NASA completed the final test of Orion\u2019s parachute system in 2018, at the U.S. Army\u2019s Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, to qualify the system for Artemis flights with astronauts. Over the course of eight tests, engineers evaluated the performance of the parachute system, consisting of 11 parachutes, during normal landing sequences as well as several failure scenarios and a variety of potential aerodynamic conditions to ensure astronauts can return safely from deep space missions. The system has a series of cannon-like mortars, pyrotechnic bolt cutters, and more than 30 miles of Kevlar lines attaching the top of the spacecraft to the 36,000 square feet of parachute canopy material. In about 10 minutes of descent through Earth\u2019s atmosphere, everything must deploy in precise sequence to slow Orion and its crew from about 300 mph to a relatively gentle 20 mph for splashdown in the ocean. 44 Orion Crew Module Uprighting System Testing In March 2019, off the coast of Atlantic",

When Orion splashes down in the ocean, it can settle in one of two positions. The CMUS deploys a series of five, bright orange airbags to flip the capsule right-side up in the event the Orion lands upside down. It takes less than four minutes for the system to upright the capsule to help protect the astronauts inside that are returning home from future deep space missions. Several tests performed with a mockup of the Orion crew capsule demonstrated that even if one of the airbags failed to inflate, the CMUS would still be able to perform as intended. The system was previously tested in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, a giant pool at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, primarily used for astronaut training, as well as off the coast of Galveston, Texas. Engineers also partnered with the Coast Guard in the Atlantic Ocean to test the CMUS in more challenging waves, similar to those where Orion is expected to land.

The LAS is managed by Langley and NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The attitude control motor and jettison motor have each been tested for the third and final time during hot, ambient and cold conditions. The abort motor has been tested twice. The final abort motor test is scheduled for 2022, marking the final test to qualify the LAS for the Artemis II mission with crew. In 2010, Orion\u2019s LAS successfully tested the system from the launch pad during a pad abort test at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. In July 2019, an ascent abort test at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida successfully demonstrated the system could outrun a speeding rocket and pull astronauts to safety under the greatest aerodynamic forces expected during ascent.

The deployment of the 24-foot wing qualification model confirmed the array unfurled properly and locked into place and that all of the mechanisms functioned as expected. Next, the test article moved into the world\u2019s most powerful reverberant acoustic test chamber, where it was blasted with more than 150 decibels and up to 10,000 hertz of sound pressure. The service module was then placed atop a vibration table to simulate launching on the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. Finally, the spacecraft\u2019s fairings and adaptor were subjected to pyro-shock testing to simulate separation scenarios during launch and return to Earth. 45 Orion Service Module Propulsion Testing NASA and ESA completed 51 test sequences, conducted in two phases, to certify the European Service Module\u2019s propulsion system for Artemis I using the Propulsion Qualification Module at the White Sands Test Facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

Orion Pressure Vessel Testing In January 2016, technicians at Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans finished welding together the primary structure of the Orion spacecraft destined for deep space and prepared it for delivery to Kennedy in February. In May 2016, engineers at Kennedy conducted a series of tests on the spacecraft\u2019s pressure vessel, or underlying structure of the crew module. Strain gauges measured the strength of the welds on the spacecraft as it was pressurized to greater than the maximum pressure it is expected to encounter on orbit. Orion Power-on Testing In August 2017, the Orion crew module was powered on at Kennedy for the first time. The tests verified the health and status of Orion\u2019s core computers and power and data units to ensure the systems communicate precisely with one another to accurately route power and functional commands throughout the spacecraft.

Over several days, the crew module was rapidly cycled between hot and cold temperatures to thermally stress the hardware and ensure the workmanship of the crew module\u2019s critical hardware and its subsystem operations. The cycle of temperatures for the initial thermal test ranged from 29 to 129 F during 105 hours of testing. Later that year, Orion\u2019s heat shield was secured to the bottom of the crew module.

The vessel is the primary structure that holds the pressurized atmosphere astronauts will breathe and work in while in the vacuum of deep space. It consists of seven large aluminum pieces that are joined together using friction-stir welding to produce a strong, yet light-weight, air- tight capsule. The pressure vessel was loaded into the crew module transportation fixture and then lowered onto a heavy equipment semi- trailer for the nearly 700-mile journey over land to Kennedy in August 2018. SLS RS-25 Engine Testing Acceptance testing is complete for all 16 RS-25 engines that served as former space shuttle main engines. Tests at Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, have shown that the engines can perform at the higher power level needed to launch the super heavy-lift SLS rocket. NASA tested the first SLS flight engine in March 2016 and completed acceptance testing in April 2019. Testing included certifying new controllers (plus one spare) to be used by the heritage RS-25 engines. Altogether, the agency has conducted 32 developmental and flight engine tests for a total of 14,754 seconds\u2014more than four hours \u2013 of cumulative hot fire. Tests with development engines also tested new parts for future engines.

Aerojet Rocketdyne made these parts with advanced manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing and have the potential to increase reliability and sustainability of the engines. SLS Booster Testing The SLS boosters are modeled after the space shuttle boosters but have an additional segment to provide more power and several other upgrades. The boosters completed five full-up test firings in a horizontal position with the final qualification motor test in June 2016 at Northrop Grumman\u2019s facility in in Promontory, Utah. While the boosters are using metal casings and parts that were flown on space shuttle missions, they have many new and upgraded parts including new insulation and avionics systems to control flight that have been tested at Kennedy Space Center where they are assembled and outfitted. The booster motor segments for the first two Artemis missions are assembled and ready for stacking with other booster components at Kennedy. Teams have started testing small solid rocket motors that will help the agency build next-generation solid rocket boosters for future SLS flights. SLS Wind Tunnel Testing The SLS team has completed extensive wind tunnel testing at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field California, Langley, and Marshall. These tests use scale rocket models to study how the vibration, base heating, and other environments affect the launch vehicle designs for both the Block 1 and Block 1B SLS configurations. 48 SLS Acoustic Testing Researchers at Plum Brook Station completed a development test on a proposed design of acoustic panels for the SLS Universal Stage Adapter.

The adapter will connect SLS and Orion on the future configurations of the rocket and provide additional cargo space. Given the extreme sound produced by the world\u2019s most powerful rocket, this test series, conducted at Plum Brook\u2019s Reverberant Acoustic Test Facility, provided data for acoustic modeling to ensure future payloads aboard the second configuration of SLS, called Block 1B, are protected from the high levels of noise and vibration experienced during launch. Even the Block 1 configuration of the rocket generates significant acoustic vibrations. Acoustic testing with a full-scale model of the SLS Block 1 was conducted early in the program at Marshall. SLS Structural Testing Engineers at Marshall completed structural testing on the 212-foot core stage and the upper part of the rocket, which includes the stage that sends the Orion spacecraft to the Moon. These tests help verify models showing the structural design can survive flight. The core has five main structures that have all undergone extensive testing. Structural testing is complete for three of the four largest structures: the engine section, the intertank, and the liquid hydrogen tank. The liquid oxygen tank has completed baseline testing. In May 2017, the parts of the rocket that make up the upper part of the rocket for Artemis I completed integrated structural testing. This included the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), the launch vehicle stage adapter and the Orion stage adapter, as well as a frangible joint assembly.

SLS Core Stage Green Run Testing The four Artemis I RS-25 engines are attached to the core stage, manufactured by Boeing, which was delivered to Stennis in January 2020 and is undergoing Green Run testing, a thorough checkout of the new rocket stage that has never flown before. Green Run testing will culminate with firing all four engines at the same time, just as they will operate during launch. There are eight test cases that make up Green Run testing. Teams completed the first test in January 2020, before pausing test operations in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. After resuming testing in May, teams have steadily progressed through the test cases, completing the fifth test in September, and preparing for a hot fire test in the fall. SLS Flight Software and Avionics Testing The core stage flight computers and avionics are distributed throughout the rocket and have undergone extensive qualification testing in a laboratory and will now be tested during the Green Run. Flight software for the avionics is in the final phase of testing in a systems integration laboratory that uses avionics identical to flight hardware. The flight software has been tested by flying thousands of simulated launches and flights replicating both nominal and contingency operations.

In January 2020, engineers, technicians and crane operators practiced lifting and stacking operations with pathfinder segments of Northrop Grumman\u2019s solid rocket boosters inside High Bay 4 of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy. More booster pathfinder operations are planned before the arrival of flight hardware this summer. SLS Testing and Progress on Artemis II and Future Missions Boeing has built all the structures for the second core stage for Artemis II and they are being outfitted at NASA\u2019s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The liquid hydrogen tank for Artemis III is built. Both the initial and evolved designs of SLS use the core stage and boosters. Much of the testing used to qualify these elements for Artemis I also applies to future flights. For Artemis II, the booster motor segments and RS-25 engines are also completed. The booster aft and forward skirts must be refurbished and outfitted at the Booster Fabrication Facility at Kennedy.

Crawler Transporter 2 (CT2) completed a test rollout of the mobile launcher for integrated testing at newly renovated Launch Pad 39B, validating it can communicate effectively with the facility systems and ground systems to perform appropriately during launch. These multi- element verification and validation tests included testing the sound suppression system, loading the cryogenic fuel system, a simultaneous umbilical swing test, and more. CT2 returned the mobile launcher to the VAB for modal testing with the mobile launcher sitting on the mount pedestals as well as with CT2 sharing the load. Exploration Ground Systems also conducted a six-hour pressurization test of the liquid oxygen tank at Launch Pad 39B, which has been upgraded for the SLS rocket. SLS will use both liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants. An initial test of xenon lights took place with the mobile launcher on the pad in October 2019, and additional lighting plans are in design. Simulated Propellant Loading In August 2019, technicians at Kennedy simulated loading propellants into a replicated test tank for Orion, including putting on the Self-Contained Atmospheric Protective Ensemble (SCAPE) suits.

During preparations for launch, these teams will be responsible for loading the Orion vehicle with propellants prior to transportation to the VAB, where it will be secured atop the SLS rocket. 50 Launch Control Center Simulations The Artemis I launch team at Kennedy is conducting a series of simulations to test critical portions of the countdown to ensure everyone is ready to handle any situation launch day throws their way. Under the leadership of Launch Director Charlie Blackwell- Thompson, the team is testing cryogenic loading, terminal count and other portions of the launch software currently in the final phases of development. Firing Room 1 in the Launch Control Center has been upgraded for SLS and Orion. Advances in computer and software systems as well as swapping copper cables for fiber optics change the way workstations are configured compared to the shuttle and Apollo eras. This allows greater situational awareness by the launch controllers, and reduces the number of controllers needed on launch day.

This lunar exploration strategy has two main components working simultaneously: 1) a near-term focus on achieving the initial human landing by 2024 as efficiently as possible with acceptable technical risk and 2) the build-up of sustainable systems, informed by our initial missions, that will allow America\u2019s human spaceflight program to maintain a robust lunar presence well into the next decade. NASA refers to these as Artemis Phase 1 and Artemis Phase 2 respectively. In addition to these two areas of Artemis, a third area of mission support spans the entire endeavor. Mission support includes the NASA capabilities, workforce, and facilities that are critical to the success of Artemis. This appendix provides a summary of the resources required through FY 2025. These resource requirements are consistent with the President\u2019s FY 2021 budget request for NASA. Activities to enable the return of humans to the Moon by 2024 This estimate includes requested funding for Exploration Systems Development Programs, Artemis I-III flights, development and operation of the human landing system (HLS), lunar surface suits and logistics.

Exploration Systems Development (ESD): ESD\u2019s mission is to develop the launch vehicle, spacecraft, and ground support systems necessary to send crew beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO). ESD consists of three programs: Orion, Space Launch Systems (SLS), and Exploration Ground Systems (EGS). The Orion spacecraft will carry humans beyond LEO, provide emergency abort capability, sustain the crew during space travel, and provide safe re-entry from deep space. The SLS will be the most powerful rocket ever built and the only rocket that can send crew in Orion with its life support systems to the Moon on a single mission. EGS develops and operates the systems and facilities needed to process and launch rockets and spacecraft during assembly, transport, and launch. In preparation of Artemis III mission to the lunar system in 2024, NASA is conducting additional testing on early Artemis missions. The Artemis I (uncrewed) mission will verify spacecraft performance and test Orion\u2019s head shield, whereas the Artemis II (crewed) will validate deep space communication and navigation systems and ensure the resilience of life support systems. Human Landing Systems (HLS): The HLS program will utilize commercial partnerships to develop and jointly deploy a landing system to transport humans to and from the lunar surface. NASA expects its commercial partners will heavily leverage NASA technology and expertise throughout the development process, leading to a lunar transportation system that will deliver humans to the lunar surface in 2024, and develop and demonstrate a more sustainable HLS for subsequent crewed missions.

Therefore, at the core of the Artemis Accords is the requirement that all activities will be conducted for peaceful purposes, per the tenets of the Outer Space Treaty. Transparency Transparency is a key principle for responsible civil space exploration and NASA has always taken care to publicly describe its policies and plans. Artemis Accords partner nations will be required to uphold this principle by publicly describing their own policies and plans in a transparent manner. Interoperability Interoperability of systems is critical to ensure safe and robust space exploration. Therefore, the Artemis Accords call for partner nations to utilize open international standards, develop new standards when necessary, and strive to support interoperability to the greatest extent practical. 72 Emergency Assistance Providing emergency assistance to those in need is a cornerstone of any responsible civil space program. Therefore, the Artemis Accords reaffirm NASA\u2019s and partner nations\u2019 commitments to the Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA\u2019s Pioneering Next Steps in Space Exploration Introduction NASA is leading our nation and our world on a journey to Mars. Like the Apollo Program, we embark on this journey for all humanity. Unlike Apollo, we will be going to stay. This is a historic pioneering endeavor\u2014a journey made possible by a sustained effort of science and exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit with successively more capable technologies and partnerships. This pioneering endeavor carries out the direction given to us in the 2010 NASA Authorization Act and in the U.S. National Space Policy. It engages all four NASA Mission Directorates and all NASA Centers and Laboratories. It enlists the best of academia and industry across the nation and builds on our existing international partnerships while embracing new ones. And like pioneering efforts before it, the journey to Mars will foster and attract new commercial enterprises. Why Mars? Mars is the horizon goal for pioneering space; it is the next tangible frontier for expanding human presence. Our robotic science scouts at Mars have found valuable resources for sustaining human pioneers, such as water ice just below the surface. These scouts have shown that Mars\u2019 geological evolution and climate cycles were comparable to Earth\u2019s, and that at one time, Mars had conditions suitable for life. What we learn about the Red Planet will tell us more about our Earth\u2019s past and future, and may help answer whether life exists beyond our home planet. Together with our partners, we will pioneer Mars and answer some of humanity\u2019s fundamental questions:",

What we learn about the Red Planet will tell us more about our Earth\u2019s past and future, and may help answer whether life exists beyond our home planet. Together with our partners, we will pioneer Mars and answer some of humanity\u2019s fundamental questions: \u2022 Was Mars home to microbial life? Is it today? Could it be a safe home for humans one day? What can it teach us about life elsewhere in the cosmos or how life began on Earth? What can it teach us about Earth\u2019s past, present, and future? Mars is an achievable goal. We have spent more than four decades on the journey to Mars, with wildly successful robotic explorers. The first human steps have been taken through science and technology research aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and in laboratories here on Earth. We are taking the next steps by developing the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion crewed spacecraft, demonstrating new operations to reduce logistics, and preparing for human missions into cislunar space, such as exploring a captured asteroid. There are challenges to pioneering Mars, but we know they are solvable. We are developing the capabilities necessary to get there, land there, and live there. 1 2 Technology drives exploration and many of the technologies we need are in various stages of conceptualization, development, or testing. Consequently, NASA will continue to make key decisions and further define steps on this journey as technology and knowledge mature.

As pioneers, we seek to blaze the trail for others, establishing a presence that leads to economic progress and broad societal benefit. We pioneer space to discover life, identify resources, foster economic growth, inspire and educate, protect ourselves from space-based threats, and leave a better future for the next generation. This goal is embodied in the idea of a human and robotic journey to Mars. It is time for the next steps, and the agency is actively developing the capabilities that will enable humans to thrive beyond Earth for extended periods of time, leading to a sustainable presence in deep space. NASA\u2019s efforts build upon the proven international and commercial partnerships at the core of the ISS. Our activities align with the Global Exploration Roadmap (GER), a product of 12 space agencies committed to expanding human presence in space. We will continue to build on partnerships with U.S. industry, academia, and our stakeholders. Our partners are developing technologies, systems, and missions to meet individual objectives, such as lunar surface operations, while contributing to the journey to Mars.

Pioneering space requires a sustained set of mutually reinforcing activities\u2014science missions, technology development, capability demonstrations, and human spaceflight\u2014to expand human presence into deep space and extend our robotic agents farther into the solar system, with the horizon goal of humans travelling to Mars and remaining on the surface. NASA\u2019s strategy, aligned with the pioneering principles, connects near-term activities and capability development to the journey to Mars and a future with a sustainable human presence in deep space. This strategy strikes a balance between progress toward horizon goals, near-term benefits, and long-term flexibility to budgetary changes, political priorities, new scientific discoveries, technological breakthroughs, and evolving partnerships. The journey to Mars reflects an integrated NASA effort, in collaboration with our partners, to advance from today\u2019s Earth Reliant human spaceflight program through the Proving Ground of cislunar space to an Earth Independent, deep-space capability. This strategy is a natural evolution of prior decades of space exploration. The era of modern space exploration began with remote observations through early telescopes, providing the knowledge necessary to design and send robotic missions to Earth orbit, planets, moons, comets, and asteroids. NASA\u2019s human spaceflight program has already demonstrated the capability for Earth Reliant human exploration, culminating today with the ISS, where astronauts and supplies are ferried between the station and Earth within hours.

Meanwhile, robotic science missions are scouting resources and characterizing potential destinations for human explorers at far more distant locations within our solar system. The Path Forward NASA and our partners are already at Mars, operating with highly effective robotic emissaries in orbit and on the surface. NASA has exploited nearly every opportunity over the past two decades (occurring every 26 months when transit between Earth and Mars is the most efficient) to send orbiters, landers, and rovers to the Red Planet with increasingly complex experiments and sensing systems. Mars orbiters have mapped with high precision the topography of the planet, begun mapping the distribution of water ice below the surface, imaged geologically ancient river deltas, and discovered likely seasonal outflows of salty liquid water in the present. They have mapped detailed mineral composition in select areas and located suitable landing 10 sites for future robotic and human missions, many with incredible science potential. Robotic landers have demonstrated that the Martian environment could have supported microbial life, as we understand it here on Earth. Additionally, robotic landers have measured radiation in transit and on the surface, and gathered data for defining entry, descent, and landing (EDL) approaches for future human missions. NASA\u2019s Mars 2020 mission will measure atmospheric entry conditions and surface dust, and demonstrate production of oxygen from atmospheric carbon dioxide while selecting and encapsulating samples for potential return to Earth.

NASA is investing in technologies and rapidly prototyping new systems, which benefit both NASA and our industry partners, while minimizing overall costs through innovative partnerships. Focus areas include solar electric propulsion with advanced ion thrusters, habitation systems, nuclear fission for Mars surface power, EDL systems, laser communications for high data rate transmission, deep-space atomic clocks for precise navigation, and many others. NASA will integrate these technologies into pioneering capabilities, providing the tools necessary for the journey to Mars. Moving from Earth Reliant toward Earth Independent In the current Earth Reliant phase of human exploration, NASA and our partners are using the ISS in LEO, supported by commercial cargo resupply services and in the near future, commercial crew transportation. The delivery and return of astronauts and cargo to the space station are measured in hours, but any journey to Mars will take many months each way, and early return is not an option. This is an entirely different operating regime, not just for physical access but also for communications with Earth-based teams. Astronauts in deep space must be more self-reliant and spacecraft systems and operations must be more automated to operate safely and productively as we explore beyond LEO. Cislunar space is the ideal Proving Ground for NASA and its partners to test systems and to practice deep-space operations, such as extravehicular activity (EVAs or spacewalks), and rendezvous and docking prior to committing crew on long missions to Mars.

These combined activities provide an optimal condition to demonstrate integrated human and robotic missions to build confidence that human missions to Mars can be safely conducted with an Earth Independent mode of operation. Our Strategy for the Journey to Mars Living and working in space require accepting risk, and the journey is worth the risk. Crews must be protected from the unique hazardous environments of deep space and on the Martian surface. Often, systems will have to operate autonomously or remain dormant for years in preparation for crew. Overcoming these challenges will be essential on the journey to Mars. These technological and operational challenges fall into three categories: transportation, sending humans and cargo through space efficiently, safely, and reliably; working in space, enabling productive operations for crew and robotic systems; and staying healthy, developing habitation systems that provide safe, healthy, and sustainable human exploration. Bridging these three categories are the overarching logistical challenges facing crewed missions lasting up to 1,100 days and exploration campaigns that span decades. 11 An Orbital ATK Cygnus is berthed to the ISS with 1.6 tons of supplies during the Orb-1 mission in January 2014.

This approach requires us to recognize and address two key challenges. The first challenge is recognition that pioneering space is as much a logistics and supply chain challenge as a technological challenge. Historically, pioneers on Earth could not rely solely on supplies from home to sustain them and neither can the first pioneers on Mars. NASA will have to learn new ways of operating in space, based on self-reliance and increased system reliability; ISRU, including recycling packaging materials and trash; and the ability to design, build, or repair systems with common, modular components. To enable the journey to Mars, NASA will invest in reusable systems with common components that are modular and extensible to multiple missions to reduce unique developments and the need for spares. Complex tradeoffs between resupply and use of in- situ resources must be first addressed before we achieve Earth Independence. NASA will use missions in the Proving Ground to validate new operational approaches and learn how to balance logistics sent from Earth with the potential benefits and challenges of using local resources. The second challenge is recognition that achieving Earth Independence will take decades and can be impacted by multiple uncertain events. NASA\u2019s strategy must be flexible and resilient to changes in the priorities of future administrations, the emergence of breakthrough technologies, discovery of new scientific knowledge, fluctuations in funding, and new partnership opportunities. Due to these uncertainties, we must make decisions with incomplete knowledge to ensure continued momentum.

As NASA transitions beyond LEO and continues to pioneer space, our vision is that private and public investments will sustain economic activity in LEO and create benefits for Earth through commercial supply and public and private demand. The First Steps: International Space Station (ISS) NASA has begun the transition from exploration to pioneering on the ISS. Occupied by an international crew continuously since November 2, 2000, the station has hosted more than 200 people from 17 countries, and is the culmination of one of the largest and most complicated international engineering efforts ever attempted. The ISS is the only microgravity platform for the long-term testing of new life support and crew health systems, advanced habitat modules, and other technologies needed to decrease reliance on Earth. Over the next decade, we will validate many of the capabilities needed to maintain a healthy and productive crew in deep space. Currently manifested or planned experiments and demonstrations include improved long-duration life support for Mars missions, advanced fire safety equipment, next-generation spacesuit technologies, high-data-rate communications, techniques to reduce logistics, large deployable solar arrays, in-space additive manufacturing, advanced exercise and medical equipment, radiation monitoring and shielding, human- robotic operations, and autonomous crew operations.

NASA and our partners\u2019 activities on the ISS are achieving key milestones and enabling a planned transition to early pioneering missions in cislunar space. Leveraging U.S. Industry: Commercial Crew and Cargo The guiding principles for pioneering space include leveraging non-NASA capabilities and partnering with industry whenever possible. NASA\u2019s acquisition strategy for commercial crew and cargo services embodies these principles. The ISS plays a key role as a destination and anchor customer for emerging commercial markets in LEO. Commercial partners, who are maturing their business models and technical approaches by providing critical services for the ISS, will be essential to enabling deep-space NASA missions. The NASA-sponsored Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program resulted in the development of new launch vehicles and cargo spacecraft. Both Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) and Orbital ATK have successfully delivered cargo to the ISS using vehicles developed with NASA support. Under the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) and follow- on contracts, commercial partners are expected to provide about six flights per year to support ISS operations. These flights are win-win arrangements for NASA and industry, as they minimize the need for costly, NASA-unique infrastructure and increase commercial access to space.

In September 2014, NASA announced the next phase of the commercial services program, Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap), under which NASA awarded contracts for crew transportation services to Boeing and SpaceX. Once the companies complete development and are certified by NASA, the agency will purchase two flights per year to deliver and return expedition crew. CCtCap will provide NASA and our international partners with additional vehicles to deliver crews to the ISS and expand research opportunities by enabling the crew aboard ISS to increase from six to seven. NASA also continues relationships with other U.S. companies that are developing alternative transportation systems. Beyond commercial crew and cargo transportation services, NASA is also developing strategies to stimulate sustained economic activity in LEO. This includes leveraging the ISS; supporting a policy and regulatory environment that promotes commercialization of LEO; facilitating a robust, self-sustaining, and cost-effective supply of U.S. commercial services that accommodates public and private demands; and stimulating broad sectors of the economy discovering benefits of LEO. 15 Our Progress and Plans on the Journey to Mars NASA relies on commercial services it helped develop, leading to economically efficient exploration 16 NASA is also leveraging industry to reinvent ground operations for a flexible, multi- user spaceport, providing launch services for both government and commercial partners.

While the exact mass and volume available for co-manifested payloads have not yet been determined, payloads about the same length, twice the width, and one-third the mass of a school bus could be launched to cislunar space with Orion. Co-manifested payloads, potentially launched as early as Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2), could include pressurized modules that extend the deep-space capabilities of the Orion spacecraft and help develop a deep-space habitation capability. Independent co-manifested payloads, such as robotic science missions, are also possible. Orion and SLS (with the EUS) provide the core transportation capabilities that support Proving Ground missions and enable the journey to Mars.

Beyond EM-2, NASA is considering a wide range of activities that not only demonstrate the ability to live and work in deep space, but also accomplish a suite of Proving Ground objectives and validate key operational capabilities required to become Earth Independent. While SLS and Orion flight rates 20 will ultimately be determined by available funding and mission requirements, NASA is working towards flying at least one crewed mission per year. Into the Proving Ground: Solar Electric Propulsion and the Asteroid Redirect Mission Solar electric propulsion (SEP) uses energy from the sun to accelerate ionized propellant to very high speeds. Compared to chemical propulsion, electric propulsion provides very low levels of thrust; however, it is incredibly efficient and can provide thrust continuously for months or years, allowing more mass to be transported with far less propellant. These systems are an order of magnitude more efficient than chemical propulsion systems, with a specific impulse (Isp) from 2,000-3,000 seconds compared to 200-500 seconds. SEP systems are also very resilient and, if refueled, could provide a reusable, in-space transportation infrastructure. Adding a SEP capability to Orion and SLS provides a robust transportation infrastructure for human missions to support the journey to Mars. High-power SEP is a key enabler for NASA\u2019s pioneering strategy, allowing NASA to pre-position infrastructure and resources while reducing the surge of launches. This could reduce the costs estimated in previous human Mars mission studies. Pre-positioning supplies months or years ahead of crew, rather than aggregating all necessary equipment and supplies in Earth orbit, is often called a split mission.

Pre-positioning supplies months or years ahead of crew, rather than aggregating all necessary equipment and supplies in Earth orbit, is often called a split mission. With several tons of xenon (Xe) propellant and solar arrays capable of generating 40 kilowatts (kW), an early SEP vehicle could efficiently position several tons of cargo throughout the solar system. A more advanced SEP system with additional power and propellant could deliver landers, habitats, and supplies to Mars orbit. NASA is considering several mission architectures that evolve from a 40 kW SEP vehicle. In an approach that leverages both SEP and chemical propulsion, a Mars SEP cargo vehicle would transport chemical return stages, habitats, and landers to Mars orbit, while crew travel separately. For this approach, the crew would rendezvous with the pre-positioned assets in Mars orbit including a surface lander and, on the return trip to Earth, chemical departure stages. In an alternative approach, NASA would use a hybrid SEP vehicle, supplemented with small chemical engines for strategic high-thrust maneuvers, to reduce trip times. This vehicle would still pre-position landers, habitats, and equipment in a cargo mode; however, for crew transit, the vehicle would contain enough propellant for a round trip and would not require chemical return stages. Both approaches are being studied as the Mars transportation architecture evolves. SEP enables near- term missions while proving capabilities for a reusable deep space transportation system 21 Our Progress and Plans on the Journey to Mars With SEP, NASA can also aggregate, refurbish, and reuse Mars transportation infrastructure in a high-energy orbit, such as lunar distant retrograde orbit (LDRO).

High performance liquid oxygen and hydrogen propulsion from the SLS Exploration Upper Stage can provide the majority of departure energy, placing payloads in these high-energy orbits and allowing the SEP or SEP- hybrid thrusters to initiate the maneuver to Mars. As an added advantage, these maneuvers can be reversed, allowing NASA to capture the Mars return vehicle for refurbishment and reuse. Developing and demonstrating advanced SEP systems early during the Proving Ground missions will accelerate our progress toward sustainable pioneering. The Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) provides a near-term opportunity to demonstrate several capabilities important for longer-duration, deep-space missions, including flight-validated SEP transportation. ARM consists of two challenging flight segments, working toward the common objective of human exploration of an asteroid. In the first segment, an advanced, high-power SEP robotic vehicle will travel to an asteroid, perform detailed reconnaissance of its surface, select a boulder-sized sample, capture it, and return to a stable orbit in cislunar space. Most robotic sample return concepts are designed to return a few hundred grams of material (e.g., NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx mission to the asteroid Bennu). All six Apollo landings returned a total of less than 400 kilograms. Leveraging SEP and advanced robotics, ARM will return several tons of material. In the second segment, astronauts will travel to the captured boulder aboard SLS and Orion, marking a historic opportunity that will allow humans to venture outside of the spacecraft to touch, investigate, and experience an asteroid firsthand.

Following the first ARM crewed mission, there will be on the order of several tons of material remaining in a stable orbit for at least 100 years, available for future exploration, scientific, commercial, or academic partners. During potential future missions, NASA could use the boulder to demonstrate ISRU identification, characterization, extraction, processing, and containment capabilities, and test EVA tools for exploring other low-gravity bodies, such as the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos. The Asteroid Redirect Robotic Vehicle (ARRV) also will be able to provide some support to visiting vehicles, including an S-band transponder for approach and docking, an X-band communications link, and about 40 kW of power. This initial cislunar infrastructure would be available to commercial partners who may also wish to understand and eventually mine resources from asteroids. Such commercial efforts could evolve into services to support in-space fueling of Mars propulsion systems. A Home Away from Home: Deep-Space Habitat Any mission to Mars will require highly reliable habitation systems to keep the crew healthy and productive in the deep-space environment during missions that last up to 1,100 days. Leveraging experience from the ISS, NASA and our 22 international and commercial partners have begun activities to evolve ISS habitation systems to meet future deep-space mission needs. With multiple crewed Orion missions to cislunar space over the next decade (launched on an evolved SLS), NASA will have many opportunities to use these habitations systems, and evolve them to a deep-space habitation capability for future Mars missions.

NASA, together with its international and commercial partners, will develop a strategy to complete \u201cMars-ready\u201d habitation system testing on Earth and on ISS. NASA and its partners will also develop an initial habitation capability for short-duration missions in cislunar space during the early 2020s and evolve this capability for long-duration missions in the later 2020s. A modular, pressurized volume would enable extended stays by crews arriving with Orion. This initial habitation capability in cislunar space would demonstrate all the capabilities and countermeasures necessary to send humans on long-duration transit missions to Mars. With this long-duration habitable volume and resources, NASA and its partners will have the opportunity to validate Mars habitat concepts and systems, including exercise systems, environmental monitoring systems, long- duration consumables storage, fire safety in high-oxygen environments, radiation shielding, and high-reliability avionics with long periods of dormancy. Understanding the transition from dormancy to crew presence and back is particularly important and can be tested with this capability. Between crewed missions, deep-space habitation capabilities could be used to test autonomous mission operations and transfer of control from the ground to vehicle systems in preparation for the longer Mars missions.

As designs for the Mars transit vehicle evolve and trajectories are determined, future Proving Ground missions could launch additional modules to incrementally build up capability. Using standardized interfaces, common structures, and modular designs, multiple pressure vessels could be aggregated, leading to a more complete habitation system to validate the full suite of capabilities needed for the journey to Mars. Commonality and standardization reduce unique developments and improve logistical efficiency. Standards also increase opportunities for international and commercial partnerships. During the habitat build-up and after initial missions, outdated or failing systems could be replaced with new capabilities that leverage the standardized interfaces. This approach provides an initial cislunar exploration capability with a pathway to a reusable, evolvable infrastructure for human missions to Mars. Standard interfaces enable multi-use, evolvable systems to support transit habitats, Mars ascent vehicles, and surface mobility 23 Our Progress and Plans on the Journey to Mars Becoming Earth Independent Part of the journey to Mars is increasing our knowledge base and assessing plans and architectures that are affordable and sustainable. When the first pioneers ventured to North America, they found familiar resources in the new land and adapted to their environment. Future pioneers of Mars will have to adapt to a more foreign, hostile environment. We will need new technologies to transform local resources into water, fuel, air, and building materials.

These capabilities enable an integrated and sustainable campaign to pioneer space. On the Red Planet: Robotic Mars Missions We are already in orbit around and on the surface of Mars with a fleet of robotic science explorers. Robotic pathfinders like Curiosity address both science and human exploration objectives, answering key questions and gathering knowledge necessary to prepare human pioneers. NASA has significant experience using robotic science and exploration pathfinders, such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission to the moon, the Dawn mission to asteroids Vesta and Ceres, and the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity. Along with conducting their high-priority science objectives, robotic pathfinders investigate and map destinations prior to human missions, collect surface samples, characterize potential landing sites, and test technologies necessary for future robotic and human destination systems. Over the next decade, NASA will rely on robotic pathfinders to help select human- accessible landing sites, pre-emplace infrastructure, and inform the design of human destination systems.

For Mars, NASA is currently developing the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport (InSight) mission, set for launch in 2016, as well as the Mars 2020 rover mission. NASA also is supporting the European Space Agency\u2019s ExoMars orbiter and lander, by testing precision navigation technology and looking for evidence of the chemical building blocks for life.

Robotic science pathfinder missions will continue well into the next decade to meet high-priority science objectives and prepare for future human missions to Mars. Robotic missions after Mars 2020 are in their conceptual stages and will address key exploration questions, such as characterizing the complex gravitational environment of the Martian moons; identifying resources and areas of scientific interest; understanding the effects of space radiation; validating EDL techniques; and studying regolith mechanics and dust.

Through rigorous and systematic studies, NASA and our international and industry partners have identified the core exploration capabilities necessary for Earth Independence. These studies build on a long history of designing deep-space missions, allowing NASA to adequately anticipate the challenges that future astronauts will face. NASA is leveraging prior experience to integrate these capabilities and design an open, evolvable architecture that allows us to confidently make investments without making specific decisions about missions in the distant future. This approach avoids the trap of designing a rigid architecture that becomes obsolete due to unanticipated changes. NASA\u2019s strategy, with its focus on capabilities, strikes a balance among progress toward horizon goals, near-term benefits, and the flexibility to respond to technology advancement, new scientific understanding, dynamic partnerships, and political direction in the coming decades. Early architecture studies provided key findings and critical decision points, which help scope future work. Some of these findings, such as the commonality of key capabilities across multiple missions, are core to NASA\u2019s strategy, while other findings inform specific missions and architectures. For example, trajectory analysis has shown LDRO and some other lunar 26 orbits are viable testing and staging locations, requiring only a small velocity change to efficiently transfer systems between a departure orbit and lunar orbits.

(Boeing) Transportation Transportation capabilities are necessary to send humans to space affordably and reliably, provide high-thrust access to staging points in cislunar space, and efficiently and safely transport crew and exploration systems on the longer journey to Mars. Commercial Cargo and Crew: Advances in transportation capabilities are only possible if NASA can shift to a more efficient mode of operations for current Earth-to-LEO transportation. NASA is partnering with commercial industry to make this shift possible. Through a commercial crew and cargo capability, NASA can rely on a less expensive, flexible commercial market to provide LEO transportation services, freeing up resources for beyond LEO and planetary transportation. Beyond Low Earth Orbit Propulsion\u2014SLS and Orion: A human-class Mars mission will require unprecedented amounts of mass transported farther than any previous human mission to space. A single Mars mission may require several 20-30 mt payloads delivered to the surface to support the crew as well as an in-space habitat, transportation stages, and supplies for round-trip missions of up to 1,100-days.

Commercial cargo services may be used to supplement the SLS's core role. In-Space Power and Propulsion: Power is critical for exploration systems; however, it is particularly important for the transportation architecture. Each human Mars mission will require several cargo launches to pre-emplace infrastructure and supplies. NASA expects to use high-powered SEP systems (150- 200 kW) that can transport cargo in a sustainable cadence. SEP requires 50 percent less propellant than chemical propulsion and uses fewer heavy-lift launches. While SEP takes longer than chemical propulsion to deliver cargo, it gives campaign planners more timeline flexibility by providing trajectory options that are less coupled to the 26-month planetary alignment that drives traditional chemical propulsion architectures. NASA\u2019s commercial crew and cargo program has bolstered U.S. launch market share globally Entry, Descent, and Landing: EDL is one of our biggest challenges. The revolutionary sky crane landing system used for the Curiosity rover placed just under 1 mt of payload on the surface of Mars. The smallest viable human- scale lander concept is more than an order of magnitude larger, and it may be necessary to land multiple 20-30 mt payloads at a human landing site. Consequently, a completely new approach is needed for human-scale EDL. For instance, supersonic retropropulsion may be necessary to provide safe and accurate atmospheric entry, descent, and precision landing on Mars.

Ascent from Planetary Surfaces: A Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) is required to transport crews from the surface to Mars orbit. The MAV drives lander and EDL requirements, which in turn impact in-space propulsion and the total mass launched from Earth, a major driver for mission cost. Current MAV designs require a minimum lander size of just under 20 mt, assuming propellant can be generated from the Martian atmosphere via ISRU. The MAV is also critical to crew survival, requiring additional reliability and redundancy, zero boil-off cryogenic storage, and limited maintenance during years of dormancy. Current studies continue to refine our understanding of this critical element. Communication and Navigation: Currently, Mars robotic rovers have data rates around two million bits per second, using a relay, such as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The ISS data rate is 300 million bits per second, two orders of magnitude faster. Future human Mars missions may need up to a billion bits per second at 1,000 times greater range than ISS, requiring laser communications to reduce weight and power. In addition, disruption and error-tolerant interplanetary networking and improved navigation capabilities are required to ensure accurate trajectories and precision landing. Working in Space Even with 50 years of human operations in space, new capabilities are necessary to sustain productive operations for crew and robotic systems at multiple destinations within the cislunar and Martian environments.

The Asteroid Redirect Crew Mission will be an early opportunity in the Proving Ground to validate new EVA systems when crews conduct spacewalks to collect samples of an asteroid boulder. The potential effects on human health resulting from surface dust and its safe removal will also need to be thoroughly understood. 30 31 Human-Robotic and Autonomous Mission Operations: Key features of sustainable pioneering are pre-emplacing equipment, reusing infrastructure, and relying on robotic capabilities to support humans. Robotic systems can help deploy systems, provide assembly, and support maintenance both when crew are present and during periods of dormancy. Robotic systems designed to work with the crew increase productivity, support EVAs, and are critical to crew safety. In-Situ Resource Utilization and Surface Power: NASA\u2019s science missions have long been searching for water beyond Earth, and they found it: everywhere. Sustainable pioneering must leverage water and other valuable in-space resources to break the logistical chain from Earth. ISRU technology enables the use of local resources, such as water in the form of ice crystals or hydrated minerals on the surface of Mars and carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, to be used as the feedstock for propellant, radiation shielding, and consumables for life support systems.

However, ISRU production for pioneering missions will require significant power to convert resources in an acceptable timeframe. ISRU systems will leverage high-power generation systems, such as solar or fission power, to produce ascent propellant. Surface Habitat and Mobility: The most important challenge for human pioneering missions is keeping the crew safe for long-duration missions up to 1,100 days. Habitats and associated systems and supplies, including food, clothing, atmospheric gases, and human interfaces, represent a significant portion of any exploration architecture. Habitation includes both in-space transit and Mars surface capabilities. NASA can reduce development costs, increase reliability, and ensure crew safety over a series of missions by reusing and maximizing commonality between the surface, transit, and Mars moons habitats and subsystems. Astronaut Karen Nyberg conducts an eye exam on herself on the ISS. Staying Healthy Deep-space crewed missions will not have regular access to the Earth\u2019s resources or the ability to rapidly return to Earth if a system fails. As crewed missions extend farther from Earth for longer periods, the habitation systems must become more reliable for safe, healthy, and sustainable human exploration.

Systems demonstrated on the ISS and Orion will be further validated in the Proving Ground environment and incorporated into a reliable long-duration, deep-space habitation capability. Pioneering Challenges 32 Crew Health: Long-duration human missions, including missions with up to 1,100 days in microgravity, potentially increase the risks of bone loss, atrophy, trauma, neurovestibular issues, loss of clear vision, and illness for the crew. To address these increased risks, crews will require new diagnostic, monitoring, and treatment tools and techniques, including exercise systems and other countermeasures, to maintain crew health. The ISS provides an ideal test bed to develop these capabilities. Radiation Safety: Outside the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, crew and electronics are exposed to high-energy particles, including infrequent, but potentially deadly, solar particle events and constant exposure to galactic cosmic rays. These high-energy particles can reduce immune response, increase cancer risk, and interfere with electronics. NASA\u2019s Human Research Program is developing methods and technologies to protect, mitigate, and treat the effects of radiation on the crew and their exploration systems. The journey to Mars will be further defined through Proving Ground missions in the next decade, as NASA and our partners retire these challenges and build on the capabilities for sustainable pioneering. We know these challenges are solvable and have a strategy in place for maturing the capabilities to address them as we expand human presence into deep space.

NASA\u2019s near-term activities focus on increasing our capacity to operate, work, and live in space while characterizing future destinations with the help of robotic science missions. Pioneering space begins with the ISS to ensure we have the reliable, long-duration systems necessary for human missions to Mars. In the Proving Ground, we will validate key capabilities through EM-1 and EM-2 along with ARM, SEP, cislunar habitation, and long-duration testing and operations. These and subsequent missions will target challenges and strategic knowledge gaps while helping develop the core capabilities necessary to expand human activity farther into deep space. Pioneering space will require a flexible, integrated, and sustained effort to develop the capabilities and tools necessary to support humans throughout our solar system. Future missions will face increasingly difficult challenges associated with transportation, working in space, and staying healthy. Many of these challenges are solved or are currently being addressed on the ISS. For the rest, NASA and our partners will leverage the Proving Ground with science missions and capability demonstrations to close the remaining gaps and ensure we have the ability to get to Mars, land safely, live and work productively, and return. 34 NASA\u2019s strategy for pioneering space provides guidance for selecting and designing missions in the Proving Ground and enables future accomplishments on the journey to Mars. The strategy helps NASA logically progress from current Earth Reliant operations on the ISS, through the Proving Ground in cislunar space, to Earth Independent pioneering with the goal of humans living and working on Mars. This strategy provides the flexibility to respond to new discoveries, opportunities, and shifts in national priorities. NASA approaches",
